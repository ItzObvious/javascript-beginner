This project accompanies a 3-part JavaScript tutorial featured in three issues of c't Magazin in summer 2014; it also appeared in the special edition "c't Programmieren". It deals with analyzing texts â€“ finding out the longest and most used words etc.

All texts and comments are in German. I'll gladly translate if there is demand.

Special thanks go to Franz Kafka who provided his story "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis") for this project.
